            The 1972 Canadian federal election was held on October 30, 1972, to elect members  of the House of Commons of Canada of the 29th Parliament of Canada. It resulted in a slim victory for the governing Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, which won 109 seats, compared to 107 seats for the opposition Progressive Conservatives led by Robert Stanfield. Trudeau's Liberals experienced a decline in support as a result of rising unemployment.<br/><br/>A further 48 seats were won by other parties and independents. On election night, the results appeared to give 109 seats to the Tories, but once the counting had finished the next day, the final results gave the Liberals a minority government and left the New Democratic Party led by David Lewis holding the balance of power.<br/><br/>This was the first national election held in Canada after the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1970.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>The election was the second fought between Liberal leader, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield.  The Liberals entered the election campaign with a 10-point lead over the Progressive Conservatives, but the spirit of Trudeaumania had worn off, and a slumping economy and rising unemployment hurt his party. Stanfield's Tories tried to capitalize on the public's perception that the Liberals were mismanaging the economy with the slogan, "A Progressive Conservative government will do better."<br/><br/>The Liberals campaigned on the slogan, "The Land is Strong", and television ads illustrating Canada's scenery.  The slogan quickly became much derided, and the party had developed few real issues to campaign on.
