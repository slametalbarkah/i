            The Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) is the workplace compensation board for provincially regulated workplaces in Ontario, Canada. As an agency of the Ontario government, the WSIB operates "at arm's length" from the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development and is solely funded by employer premiums, administration fees, and investment revenue. The WSIB is one of the largest compensation boards in North America and is primarily responsible for administering and enforcing the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Act (WSIA).<br/><br/>Over 100 years old, WSIB covers over five million people in more than 300,000 workplaces across Ontario and works to promote health and safety in the workplace with a goal of one day having zero work-related injuries or illnesses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Hon. Sir William Ralph Meredith, Chief Justice of Ontario, is the founding father of Workmen's Compensation in Ontario and by extension Canada.<br/><br/>In 1910, Ontario Premier Sir James Whitney [1905 - 1914] appointed Sir William Meredith to head the first Royal Commission into the "laws relating to the liability of employers to make compensation to their employees for injuries received in the course of their employment which are in force in other countries, and as to how far such laws are found to work satisfactorily".<br/><br/>In 1913 Sir William Meredith delivered his Final Report. The agreement between workers and employers creating the first workers compensation board in Canada was called the Historic Trade Off.<br/><br/>However due to pressure from employers the Final Report was shelved.
