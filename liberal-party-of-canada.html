            The Liberal Party of Canada (LPC; Canadian French: Parti libéral du Canada, PLC) is a federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum, with their main rival, the Conservative Party, positioned to their right and the New Democratic Party positioned to their left. The party is described as "big tent", practising "brokerage politics", attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. The Liberal Party is the longest-serving and oldest active federal political party in the country, and has dominated federal politics of Canada for much of its history, holding power for almost 70 years of the 20th century. As a result, it has sometimes been referred to as Canada's "natural governing party".<br/><br/>Founded in 1867, the party first came into power in 1873 under Alexander Mackenzie, but were voted out five years later due to the economic conditions at the time. They would not come back to office until 1896; Wilfrid Laurier was prime minister from that year until the party's defeat in 1911 and his tenure was marked by several compromises between English and French Canada. The party then governed again from 1921 to 1926, from 1926 to 1930, and from 1935 to 1948 under William Lyon Mackenzie King and then under Louis St. Laurent from 1948 to 1957, both of whom gradually built a Canadian welfare state. Lester B. Pearson expanded the welfare state during his tenure as prime minister from 1963 to 1968, while his successor, Pierre Trudeau, continued this expansion while promoting economic nationalism, social progressivism, and a more independent foreign policy during his governance from 1968 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1984.
