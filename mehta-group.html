            The Mehta Group of Companies, commonly referred to as the Mehta Group, is an Indian conglomerate based in Mumbai and headquartered in Gandhinagar, with subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Kenya and Uganda. The group employs in excess of 55,000 people worldwide, and has an asset base in excess of US$2.1 billion, as of December 2024. The group's businesses include investments in sugar, cement, packaging, floriculture, engineering, electrical cable, consulting, management, insurance, International Trade and International Finance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The group, founded by Nanji Kalidas Mehta (1887–1969), who was born in India in the late 19th century. In 1900, at the age of 13 years, he migrated to Uganda and started a series of businesses that included a tea plantation, a cotton ginnery, a sugarcane plantation and a sugar factory.<br/><br/>During the 1930s, having established himself in Uganda, Mehta began operations in India. He set up a textile mill and ginning factory in Porbandar, Gujarat, and a trading company in Bombay. Later, a cement plant (Saurashtra Cement Limited) was established in 1956.<br/><br/>In 1972, Idi Amin, then leader of Uganda, expelled all Asians from the country; all of the group's Ugandan possession were surrendered, many to the government-controlled Uganda Development Corporation. The group concentrated on their non-African businesses; setting up a consultancy in India and a plastics plant in Canada becoming a truly International conglomerate during the 1970s.
