            The Canadian Dental Care Plan is a dental insurance program funded by the Government of Canada to provide dentistry services to uninsured Canadians that meet certain criteria. It replaces a temporary dental benefit program established in 2022 for children under 12 who did not have dental insurance coverage, which was terminated in June 2024.<br/><br/>In the 2022 federal budget, the impending program was estimated to cost $1.7 billion annually. The 2023 Canadian federal budget allocated $23 million over two years to collect oral health data for use of the program, $13 billion for Health Canada to implement the program over five years, and $4.4 billion annually thereafter for program costs.<br/><br/>The program began its staggered enrollment rollout in December 2023 with mailings to individuals at least 87 years old.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The 2021 Canadian federal election resulted in a minority government for the incumbent Liberal Party of Canada led by Justin Trudeau, establishing the 44th Canadian Parliament. Six months later, the New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP) led by Jagmeet Singh formed a confidence and supply agreement with the Liberal Party to ensure the latter would govern until 2025. The NDP support was contingent on the Liberals agreeing to a set of priorities for the session of Parliament, among them to establish national dental care and pharmacare programs. The dental care program had been a long-standing priority for the NDP, which had campaigned during the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections to implement such a program if elected.<br/><br/>In 2020, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated it would cost $1.3 billion to implement a similar program.
