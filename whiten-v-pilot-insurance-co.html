            Whiten v Pilot Insurance Co, 2002 SCC 18, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595 is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the availability of punitive damages in contract. The case related to the oppressive conduct of an insurance company in dealing with the policyholders' claim following a fire. According to the majority, "[t]his was an exceptional case that justified an exceptional remedy."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>On January 18, 1994, the Whitens discovered a fire in their home in Haliburton County, Ontario. The family fled their home in the night wearing only their pajamas, and one member of the family suffered serious frostbite to his feet. The fire destroyed the Whiten's home, possessions, and resulted in the deaths of their three cats. The family rented a small cottage nearby and received a single payment of $5,000 from the Pilot Insurance Company for living expenses, and subsequently cut off support for the family.<br/><br/>The local fire chief concluded the fire was accidental and concluded it started from a malfunctioning kerosene heater on the porch of the home. As firefighters on scene did not find evidence of arson, the Fire Marshall's office was not called to investigate. The independent insurance adjustor retained by Pilot Insurance investigated the fire and concluded based on the physical evidence and family's conduct that the fire was accidental.<br/><br/>Pilot Insurance found that the family was behind on mortgage payments and that the Whiten's were arranging refinancing.
