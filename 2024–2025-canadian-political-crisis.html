            A political crisis emerged in Canada after Chrystia Freeland, the then-minister of finance and deputy prime minister, resigned from Cabinet on 16 December 2024. The events "sent shockwaves" through Canadian politics, leading to calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign. On 6 January 2025, Trudeau announced his pending resignation as leader of the Liberal Party and as the prime minister of Canada. He also asked Governor General Mary Simon to prorogue Parliament until March.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chrystia Freeland had been a member of Trudeau's government since he took office in 2015, and served in several key roles. In 2019, she was appointed deputy prime minister, and in 2020, she took the role of finance minister. Her prominence in the Trudeau government, and being tasked with critical files, often led her to being nicknamed the "minister of everything", and she was widely seen as a potential successor to Trudeau for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Freeland was also seen as exceptionally loyal to Trudeau.<br/><br/>Trudeau had, by then, been in power for nine years following his 2015 election victory. Trudeau had been reduced to a minority government in both the 2019 and 2021 elections.
