            The Bank of British North America was founded by royal charter issued in 1836 in London, England. British North America was the common name by which the British colonies and territories that now comprise Canada were known prior to 1867.<br/><br/>By 1899, the bank had branches in London, Brantford, Hamilton, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Midland, Quebec City, Saint John, N.B., Brandon, Winnipeg, Fredericton, Halifax, Victoria, Vancouver, Rossland, Kaslo, Trail, Ashcroft, Greenwood, Atlin, Bennett, B.C., and Dawson City. It was the first bank operating in British Columbia.<br/><br/>Like the other Canadian chartered banks, it issued its own bank notes, 1852 to 1911. The end dates are the final dates appearing on notes, which may have circulated for some time after. The Bank of Canada was established through the Bank of Canada Act of 1934 and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency.<br/><br/>The Bank of British North America merged with the Bank of Montreal in 1918.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Historic buildings ==<br/><br/>On the Registry of Historical Places of Canada are the former Bank of British North America in Dawson, Yukon (1899) and Winnipeg, Manitoba (1903–04).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 49 Yonge Street, Toronto ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first Toronto branch, designed by John George Howard was built in 1845, with exterior work by John Cochrane and Brothers, at the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Wellington.
