<h1>LLQP</h1>
            
            LLQP (Life Licence Qualification Program) is part of the Canadian licensing regime for life insurance sales people. Before an advisor in the financial services sector is allowed to begin selling life insurance products, they must complete and pass LLQP, and earn a certificate of completion. Once the certification exam is completed, and criminal records checks are submitted, applicants may apply to their provincial insurance council to write the licensing exam.  Once the provincial exam is completed and passed, the applicant may complete the requirements to apply for a licence to sell life insurance, accident and sickness products, and life insurance related investment products like Segregated funds and annuities.  The LLQP exam certificate is valid in all provinces and territories except Quebec, which uses a separate system altogether.<br/><br/>LLQP is an entry-level program.  In order to become eligible to work for many companies, such as Freedom 55 and Sun Life, a candidate must first complete and pass the LLQP.  Upon completion of the LLQP, it is possible for the candidate to apply to write the provincial certification exam, successful completion of which will allow the candidate to apply for a certificate (often known as a licence) to sell life insurance and related products, such as annuities and segregated funds. There are two versions of the LLQP: the "full LLQP" and the LLQP Accident &amp; Sickness (A&amp;S). The full version combines life insurance and accident and sickness insurance training. The A&amp;S version covers accident and sickness insurance only.
