            The North American Life Assurance Company, commonly known as North American Life, was an insurance company headquartered in Newtonbrook, Toronto, Ontario.<br/><br/>In 1995, it was one of the largest mutual insurance companies in North America with US$4.48 billion in assets before merging with The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company to form Manulife Financial the following year.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Nineteenth century ===<br/><br/>Following the defeat of the Liberal government in the federal election of 1878, the outgoing prime minister Alexander Mackenzie moved from Ottawa to Toronto. The following year, Mackenzie's friends endeavored to find him employment and decided to sponsor the incorporation of an insurance company. The company was formed on 15 May 1879, when the "Act to incorporate the 'North American Mutual Life Assurance Company' " received royal assent. Mackenzie served as its first president and George William Allan, a Conservative, as vice-president. Apart from Allan, virtually all of the company's founding members were Liberal luminaries, among them Donald Alexander Macdonald, Edward Blake, George Brown, Richard John Cartwright, and OIiver Mowat. From its inception, the company was national in scope, having agents in all provinces by 1882. Mackenzie served as president until 1892, though for the last few years he was inactive. He was succeeded by John L. Blaikie.
