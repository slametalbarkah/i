            Desjardins General Insurance (DGI) is the P&amp;C insurance subsidiary of Desjardins General Insurance Group, itself a subsidiary of Desjardins Group. The brand is sister with Desjardins Financial Security, and both of them regroup under the banner of Desjardins Insurance.They now serve customers in three provinces of Canada: Quebec, Alberta and Ontario. DGI is one of the property and casualty leaders in Canada, and in 2014, Desjardins General Insurance ranked third for customer satisfaction in Quebec.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== About ==<br/><br/>Their main products are auto insurance, home insurance and business insurance, and are available through agents in the Desjardins Caisses network, Client Care Centres, website and mobile app.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1944, Desjardins Group's first subsidiary was created under the name of "Société d'assurance des caisses populaires (SACP)", today rebranded Desjardins General Insurance. It was created to meet everybody's need, from their members to themselves: it offered in a single-contract protection against fire, hold-ups, burglaries and write-offs.<br/><br/>In 1987, in order to save their insurance company that was having financial problems, they completely turned around their business model and launched direct insurance. Insurance was now available directly through the caisses and call networks. It is considered to be "one of the most controversial developments to hit the industry", because it affected not only the Desjardins Group, but also the traditional brokerage network territory. They almost had to shut down, and had to go to court to defend their rights before their model was accepted.
