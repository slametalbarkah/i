            An International Motor Insurance Card System is an arrangement between authorities and insurance organizations of multiple states to ensure that victims of road traffic accidents do not suffer from the fact that injuries or damage sustained by them were caused by a visiting motorist rather than a motorist resident in the same country.<br/><br/>Additionally to extending the insurance coverage territorial scope such systems have the benefit for motorists to avoid the need to obtain insurance cover at each of the frontiers of the countries which they visit.<br/><br/>There are multiple motor insurance systems around the world, established on regional basis. The first was the Green Card system established in 1949 in Europe, but later other regions followed suit.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Green card system ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Council of Bureaux (COB) maintains an international motor insurance card system in and around Europe where the certificate issued is known by the name green card. In 1949 the system was established in the framework of UNECE. At later stage the EU and EFTA were involved and reflecting the deepening of the links with them the CoBx secretariat was relocated from London to Brussels in 2006.<br/><br/>Around 300,000 motor accidents a year were covered in Europe by the green card system during the year 2004 according to a survey.<br/><br/>In 2016, the green card system counts around 377,666 international accidents within the green card area.<br/><br/>At the origin, the green card was checked while crossing the border. However, inside the European single market the green card is no longer checked at internal borders.
