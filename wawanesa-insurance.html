It was founded by Alonzo Fowler Kempton, who started the company using money invested by local farmers. After two weeks, Charles Kerr, Alonzo's partner, completed the company's first policy, insuring a thresher for $600 at a premium of $24 for three years.<br/><br/>A small room was rented above a local drugstore. The staff consisted of Kempton as the secretary-manager, and Charles Kerr as the bookkeeper.
