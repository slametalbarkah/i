            Social insurance is a form of social welfare that provides insurance against economic risks. The insurance may be provided publicly or through the subsidizing of private insurance. In contrast to other forms of social assistance, individuals' claims are partly dependent on their contributions, which can be considered insurance premiums to create a common fund out of which the individuals are then paid benefits in the future.<br/><br/>Types of social insurance include:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Public health insurance<br/><br/>Social Security<br/><br/>Public Unemployment Insurance<br/><br/>Public auto insurance<br/><br/>Universal parental leave<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Features ==<br/><br/>The contributions of individuals is nominal and never goes beyond what they can afford<br/><br/>the benefits, eligibility requirements and other aspects of the program are defined by statute;<br/><br/>explicit provision is made to account for the income and expenses (often through a trust fund);<br/><br/>it is funded by taxes or premiums paid by (or on behalf of) participants (but additional sources of funding may be provided as well); and<br/><br/>the program serves a defined population, and participation is either compulsory or so heavily subsidized that most eligible individuals choose to participate.<br/><br/>Social insurance has also been defined as a program whose risks are transferred to and pooled by an often government organisation legally required to provide certain benefits.<br/><br/>In the United States, programs that meet these definitions include Social Security, Medicare, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation program, the Railroad Retirement Board program and state-sponsored unemployment insurance programs. The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is also a social insurance program.<br/><br/>The World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on The Changing Nature of Work considers the appropriateness of traditional social insurance models that are based on steady wage employment in light of persistently large informal sectors in developing countries and the decline in standard employer-employee relationships in advanced countries.<br/><br/>Social insurance is a public insurance that provides protection against economic risks. Participation in social insurance is compulsory.
