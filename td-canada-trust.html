            TD Canada Trust, commonly shortened in marketing to simply TD, is the Canadian commercial banking division of the multinational TD Bank Group. It is the second-largest commercial bank in Canada by assets, behind only the Royal Bank of Canada. TD Canada Trust offers a range of financial services and products to more than 10 million Canadian customers through more than 1,100 branches and 2,600 ATMs.<br/><br/>In addition to the countrywide network of TD branches and ATMs in Canada, the bank has a network of mobile mortgage specialists, financial planners, private bankers, investment advisors, and portfolio managers.<br/><br/>The current TD Canada Trust division was formed after TD's acquisition of Canada Trust in 2000; prior to this merger, the institution's retail operations were branded TD Bank. All new and most existing accounts are officially issued by Toronto-Dominion Bank (institution number: 004), although Canada Trust (institution number: 509) remains a separate subsidiary entity, and it remains the issuer of accounts opened at that institution prior to the merger.<br/><br/>Since 2012, TD has been phasing out the "Canada Trust" part of its name from its logo online, in advertisements, and on stationery. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Bank of Toronto (founded in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (founded in 1869) merged on 1 February 1955 to form TD Bank. Canada Trust, founded in 1864 in London, Ontario as Huron and Erie Savings and Loan Society, was acquired by TD Bank in 2000, after which TD adopted the new brand name "TD Bank Financial Group".<br/><br/>Canada Trust's retail division was merged with TD's existing retail banking operations over the course of 2000 and 2001 to form "TD Canada Trust".
