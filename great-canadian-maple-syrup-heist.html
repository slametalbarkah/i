            The Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist (French: vol de sirop d'érable du siècle, lit. 'maple syrup heist of the century') was the theft over several months in 2011 and 2012 of nearly 3,000 tonnes (3,000 long tons; 3,300 short tons) of maple syrup, valued at C$18.7 million (equivalent to C$24.1 million in 2023) from a storage facility in Quebec. The facility was operated by the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers (French: Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec, FPAQ) which represents 77 percent of the global maple syrup supply.<br/><br/>Adjusted for inflation, the heist is the most valuable in Canadian history.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/>In 1958, a group of maple syrup producers in Quebec participated in a joint plan to jointly market maple syrup.  This effort inspired the creation of a larger agreement in 1966 that spread throughout Quebec, an agreement that became known as the Federation of Maple Syrup Producers of Quebec (French: Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec, FPAQ),  known since 2018 as the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers (French: Producteurs et productrices acéricoles du Québec, PPAQ). In a series of steps between 1989 and 2003, its powers were expanded from a limited mandate of negotiating prices to the status of a legal cartel, since all syrup produced in Quebec must be sold to the federation and it has sole control over setting prices and production quotas.<br/><br/>As of 2000, the Federation maintains a strategic reserve of maple syrup, officially known as the International Strategic Reserve (ISR), housed at four sites in rural towns in Quebec. The pool was established by charging producers to transfer 25 percent of their crops to the pool, which made it possible to stabilize the price of maple syrup despite the fluctuations in output, which changes every year, which in turn facilitated marketing to food producers and helped maintain high prices. The producers get paid for the syrup they gave to the reservoir only when it is sold. The syrup is stored in barrels where, under proper storage conditions, it can be kept for years.
