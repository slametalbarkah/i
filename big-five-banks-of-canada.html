All five banks are classified as Schedule I banks that are domestic banks operating in Canada under government charter. The banks' shares are widely held, with any entity allowed to hold a maximum of twenty percent.<br/><br/>According to a ranking produced by Standard &amp; Poor's, in 2017, the Big Five banks of Canada are among the world's 100 largest banks, with TD Bank, RBC, Scotiabank, BMO, and CIBC at 26th, 28th, 45th, 52nd, and 63rd place, respectively. RBC and TD Bank are also on the Financial Stability Board's list of systemically important banks as of 2020.<br/><br/>The term “Big Six” is sometimes used to include Canada's next largest bank, National Bank of Canada.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>The Big Five banks, listed in order of market capitalization on the Toronto Stock Exchange as of year-ended 2023, with their current corporate brand names and corporate profiles according to their latest annual report, all monetary amounts are in billions of Canadian dollars, are:<br/><br/><br/><br/>In modern history, Royal Bank (RBC) has always been the largest by a significant margin, although TD Bank has caught up to RBC in recent years.
