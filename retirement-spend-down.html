            At retirement, individuals stop working and no longer get employment earnings, and enter a phase of their lives, where they rely on the assets they have accumulated, to supply money for their spending needs for the rest of their lives.  Retirement spend-down, or withdrawal rate, is the strategy a retiree follows to spend, decumulate or withdraw assets during retirement.<br/><br/>Retirement planning aims to prepare individuals for retirement spend-down, because the different spend-down approaches available to retirees depend on the decisions they make during their working years.  Actuaries and financial planners are experts on this topic.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Importance ==<br/><br/>More than 10,000 Post-World War II baby boomers will reach age 65 in the United States every day between 2014 and 2027.   This represents the majority of the more than 78 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964.  As of 2014, 74% of these people are expected to be alive in 2030, which highlights that most of them will live for many years beyond retirement. By the year 2000, 1 in every 14 people was age 65 or older. By the year 2050, more than 1 in 6 people are projected to be at least 65 years old. The following statistics emphasize the importance of a well-planned retirement spend-down strategy for these people:<br/><br/><br/><br/>87% of workers do not feel very confident about having enough money to retire comfortably.
