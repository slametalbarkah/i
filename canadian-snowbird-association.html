            The Canadian Snowbird Association (CSA; French: Association canadienne des « snowbirds ») is a national, not-for-profit organization dedicated to defending and improving the rights and privileges of traveling Canadians (Also known as snowbirds).<br/><br/>Founded in 1992 in Lakeland, Florida, the CSA was formed to oppose the reduction of payments by several Canadian provinces, for out-of-country emergency medical care, and a right enshrined in the portability section of the Canada Health Act (Sec. 11(1)(b)(ii)).<br/><br/>The CSA works with various government bodies within Canada and the U.S. to advocate on behalf of its members on issues such as health.<br/><br/>In 2017, the Canadian Snowbird Association (CSA) was approximated to have 110,000 members across Canada.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Advocacy ==<br/><br/>The Canadian Snowbird Association´s advocacy efforts are informed by the following principles:<br/><br/><br/><br/>To act upon and create a beneficial environment for members by promoting and protecting their interests and rights;<br/><br/>To act in anticipation of possible changes in existing programs and services that may have adverse effects;<br/><br/>To act in response to needs for new and appropriate services and programs.<br/><br/>The lobbying initiatives of the CSA are financed by the donations made by the membership.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Canada ===<br/><br/>Since its inception, the Canadian Snowbird Association has been involved in working with governments across Canada on issues of importance to travelling Canadians. In 1993, the government of New Brunswick proposed to reduce the amount of time that residents could spend outside of the province, while maintaining their provincial health coverage from six months to 90 days. As a result of the advocacy work of the CSA, the New Brunswick government eventually shelved the proposal and maintained the existing six-month residency requirement.
