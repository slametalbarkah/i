            Pierre Marcel Poilievre (born June 3, 1979) is a Canadian politician currently serving as the leader of the Official Opposition and the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada since 2022. He has served as the member of Parliament (MP) for Carleton since 2004.<br/><br/>Born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Poilievre graduated in 2008 with a bachelor's degree in international relations from the University of Calgary. In 2000, he moved to Ottawa to work for Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day. First elected in the 2004 federal election, he initially represented the riding of Nepean—Carleton before it was reconfigured as Carleton. Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, he held various parliamentary secretary roles from 2006 to 2013 before serving as minister for democratic reform from 2013 to 2015 and concurrently as minister of employment and social development in 2015. From 2017 to 2022, he was the Conservative Party’s shadow minister for finance and was briefly shadow minister for jobs and industry.<br/><br/>Poilievre ran in the 2022 Conservative Party leadership election, winning a landslide on the first ballot. Described as a populist, he has primarily focused on economic issues, especially the cost of living in Canada and arguing for the repeal of the federal carbon tax. Poilievre is considered to be part of the Blue Tory faction within the Conservative Party.
