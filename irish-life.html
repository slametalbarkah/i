            Irish Life Assurance plc, commonly known as Irish Life, is an Irish financial services group, providing private and workplace pensions, health insurance, protection, and investments to its customers. Irish Life has been part of the Great-West Lifeco group of companies since 2013, one of the world’s leading life assurance organisations, when the Irish Government sold the business. Prior to 2012, Irish Life was part of Permanent TSB.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Irish Life assurance company was created in 1939 with state assistance and concentrated on life assurance and investment products. By 1936, as a result of the Great Depression, many life assurance companies were technically insolvent. The four which merged to form Irish Life (and their years of incorporation) were the City of Dublin Assurance (1925); Irish Life and General Assurance (1923); Irish National Assurance (1919); and Munster and Leinster Assurance (1929). Later, some British companies shed their Irish operations and merged them into this new company. These were Prudential Assurance, Britannic Assurance, Liverpool Victoria, Pearl Assurance, and Refuge Assurance Company. The 1939 company followed the procedures of the Prudential, its largest component. The intention was to form a new company and then release its shares back on the market. However, other events in 1939 made shares in a life assurance company less attractive.
