            Gore Mutual Insurance Company is a Canadian insurance company that provides home insurance, vehicle insurance, and business insurance.<br/><br/>Gore Mutual was founded in 1839 and is Canada's oldest property and casualty insurer. As of 2014 it had over $475 million in premiums and over $1.1 billion in assets. Gore Mutual has three offices in Canada. The head office is located in Cambridge, Ontario, and has offices in Vancouver and Toronto. <br/><br/>The firm has a favorable reputation with the Insurance Brokers Association of Ontario (IBAO).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Pre-Canadian Confederation (–1867) ===<br/><br/>After a failed attempt in 1837, Gore Mutual Insurance, known at that time as "The Gore District Mutual Fire Insurance Company", was created by an unknown businessman from Brantford, Ontario, on June 18, 1839, after rediscovering the subscription book that was originally created in 1837. Gore Mutual began business with only one paid officer, William A. Walker, who also held the role of secretary-treasurer. In November 1839, William A. Walker was also given the title of traveling agent. He was responsible for traveling on horseback in order to expand Gore Mutual's operations across the Galt district.
