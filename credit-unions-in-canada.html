            This is a list of banks in Canada, including chartered banks, credit unions, trusts, and other financial services companies that offer banking services and may be popularly referred to as "banks".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Largest banks ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Big Five ===<br/><br/>The top five Canadian banks are collectively referred to as the "Big Five" due to their dominant position and significant influence within the country's banking and financial industry. This term has been used for many years to characterize these major banks, and it highlights their substantial market share and impact on Canada's economy. The financial sector of Canada is especially concentrated in these banks, which has been seen as a result of protectionist policies of the government and the country's small and dispersed population. These banks grew at an extraordinary rate of 10.7 percent per year, on average, from 2008 to 2018 compared with 3.64 percent for the five largest U.S. banks. While most Canadian banks operate only within Canada, the Big Five are best described as Canadian multinational financial conglomerates that each have a large Canadian banking division.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Big Six ===<br/><br/>National Bank of Canada, which began as a regional bank in Quebec but expanded nationally, is the sixth largest Canadian bank. In 2025 it took over the Canadian Western Bank. In 2022, Canada’s Big Six held about 93% of all banking assets in the country. It is the same share they held a decade earlier, and a decade before that.
