            Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company is a Canadian constitutional law decision in 1878, dealing with the taxation and licensing powers of the provinces under the federal-provincial division of powers.<br/><br/>The case concerned a Quebec statute which imposed a licence fee on insurance companies.  The issue was whether the fee exceeded provincial authority under the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867). The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) in Britain, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire, held that the statute was unconstitutional.<br/><br/>This was the first case where the JCPC considered the scope of provincial taxation powers and licensing powers under the Constitution Act, 1867.  It was also the first case where the JCPC held that a provincial statute was unconstitutional under the division of powers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Facts ==<br/><br/>In 1875, the Legislature of Quebec enacted a statute which required every insurance company conducting business in Quebec to take out a licence.  The licence fee was calculated as a percentage of the amounts insured by the insurance policies the company issued.  The insurance company was to pay the fee by means of stamps purchased from the provincial government, which the insurance company was to attach to each insurance policy it issued.  An insurance company which did not attach the necessary stamps to a policy was subject to a fine of $50 for each failure to do so.
