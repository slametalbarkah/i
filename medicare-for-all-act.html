            The Medicare for All Act (abbreviated M4A), also known as the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act or United States National Health Care Act, is a bill first introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Representative John Conyers (D-MI) in 2003, with 38 co-sponsors. In 2019, the original 16-year-old proposal was renumbered, and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) introduced a broadly similar, but more detailed, bill, HR 1384, in the 116th Congress. As of November 3, 2019, it had 116 co-sponsors still in the House at the time, or 49.8% of House Democrats.<br/><br/>The act would establish a universal single-payer national health insurance system in the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada's Medicare and Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples. Under a single-payer system, most medical care would be paid for by the federal government, ending the need for private health insurance and premiums, and re-casting private insurance companies as providing purely supplemental coverage, to be used when non-essential care is sought. The national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing insurance premiums, but also by savings realized through the provision of preventive universal health care and the elimination of insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs.<br/><br/>On September 13, 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced a parallel bill in the United States Senate, with 16 co-sponsors. The act would establish a universal single-payer health care system in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Provisions ==<br/><br/>The laws proposed are not necessarily identical year-over-year. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== John Conyers' bill ===<br/><br/>The summary of the National Health Care Act as proposed in the 111th Congress (2009–2010) includes the following elements, among others:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Expands the Medicare program to provide all individuals residing in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and territories of the United States with tax-funded health care that includes all medically necessary care.
