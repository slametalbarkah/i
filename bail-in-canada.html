<h1>Bail in Canada</h1>
            
            Bail in Canada refers to the release (or detention) of a person charged with a criminal offence prior to being tried in court or sentenced.  The Canadian Bill of Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantee the right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause.  That right is implemented by the Criminal Code, which provides several ways for a person to be released prior to a court appearance.  A person may be released by a peace officer or by the courts. A release by the courts is officially known as a judicial interim release. There are also a number of ways to compel a person's appearance in court without the need for an arrest and release.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Canadian law of bail is derived from the principles of bail which evolved in the English common law.  In particular, the right to be released without excessive bail was enshrined in the English Bill of Rights, which was part of the law of the colonies in British North America.<br/><br/>Prior to Confederation in 1867, the individual colonies each had the authority to enact local laws relating to bail.  After 1867, the Parliament of Canada acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the criminal law, including the law of bail.
