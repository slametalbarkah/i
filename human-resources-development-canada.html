            Human Resources Development Canada (French: Développement des ressources humaines Canada, HRDC) was a department of the Government of Canada with the responsibility over a wide portfolio of social services.<br/><br/>HRDC was based at a government office facility at Place du Portage IV in Gatineau (formerly downtown Hull, Quebec).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>HRDC was created in 1993 by Prime Minister Kim Campbell's government in an attempt to decrease the size of the federal cabinet by grouping several departments with similar responsibilities. In the case of HRDC, the former Department of Employment and Immigration formed its nucleus.<br/><br/>HRDC's creation was probably the most enduring decision taken by Campbell's short-lived administration.  The new department, however was poorly focused and had a wide range of institutional cultures from the merged bureaucracies; it also had one of the larger departmental budgets and a variety of responsibilities ranging from the unemployment insurance program to the issuance of social insurance numbers and job training and counselling.<br/><br/>Although HRDC was operationally functional since 1993, the Department of Human Resources Development Act was not adopted until 29 May 1996  and officially entered into force on 12 July 1996 when it received Royal Assent and was published in the Canada Gazette.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Department of Employment and Immigration ===<br/><br/>The Department of Employment and Immigration, in operation from 1977 to 1996, was the department that preceded HRDC and succeeded the Department of Manpower and Immigration.<br/><br/>The department was abolished on 12 July 1996. The role previously held by the Minister of Employment and Immigration in regard to labour was taken on by the Minister of Human Resources Development, while the portfolio for immigration was transferred to the office of Minister of Citizenship and Immigration following the reorganization of the government and formation of the department for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
