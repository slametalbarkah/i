<h1>List of Canadians by net worth</h1>
            
            The following list of Canadians by net worth includes the wealthiest Canadian individuals and families as determined by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and The World's Billionaires by Forbes. In addition to Bloomberg and Forbes, some other organizations and publications also measure the wealth of high net-worth individuals and families.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== List of Canadians by net worth ==<br/><br/>Several publications have produced listings of the world's wealthiest people by net worth, including Bloomberg and Forbes. However, there are differences between these listings, with the number of billionaires that exist, as well as their estimated net worth.<br/><br/>According to Canadian Business, in November 2017 there were at least 100 Canadian billionaires when using the Canadian dollar to evaluate net worth. This number differs from The World's Billionaires by Forbes, and the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as they both use the United States dollar to evaluate net worth. Publications may also provide different estimates for an individual's net worth, leading to disagreement between the publications.<br/><br/>Several Canadian individuals/families that hold multiple citizenships and have a net worth exceeding C$1 billion may also not be listed as Canadians by the aforementioned publications. For example, Elon Musk, considered to be the richest person in the world in 2021, holds multiple citizenships, including Canadian citizenship; although Bloomberg and Forbes' listing of billionaires list Musk as an American.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Bloomberg ===<br/><br/>Bloomberg L.P. maintains a daily ranking of the net worth analysis of the world's richest people in the world on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is updated "at the close of every trading day in New York", with the Top 500 provided online each day.
