            Disability benefits are a form of financial assistance or welfare designed to support disabled individuals who cannot work due to a chronic illness, disease or injury. Disability benefits are typically provided through various sources, including government programs, group disability insurance provided by employers or associations or private insurance policies typically purchased through a licensed insurance agent or broker, or directly from an insurance company.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of disability benefits is to offer a safety net for those whose earning capacity is impacted by disability, ensuring they have the necessary support for their living expenses.  Benefits compensate for lost income, thus playing a crucial role in helping the disabled maintain financial stability and quality of life in the face of challenging health circumstances. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== United Kingdom ==<br/><br/>In the United Kingdom, disability benefits are covered by Department for Work and Pensions.
