            Canadian Tire Services Ltd. (CTSL), doing business as Canadian Tire Bank (French: Banque Canadian Tire), is the financial services subsidiary of the Canadian Tire retail chain. The bank is based in Oakville, Ontario, and has additional business operations in St. Catharines and Welland, Ontario. Between 1968 and 2016 (with some branding continuing until 2018), Canadian Tire Services Ltd. was known as Canadian Tire Financial Services Ltd. (CTFS or CTFSL).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1968, Canadian Tire purchased Midland Shoppers Credit Limited, a small company founded in 1961 to provide third-party credit processing for local retailers in the Niagara Region. After its acquisition, the company was renamed "Canadian Tire Acceptance Limited (CTAL)", and later "Canadian Tire Financial Services Limited".<br/><br/>Canadian Tire Bank (CTB), a Schedule 1 (domestic, deposit-taking) bank under the Bank Act, was founded in 2003 and took over financial services that had been provided by CTFS. In addition to MasterCard credit card services, Canadian Tire Bank also launched high interest savings accounts, tax-free savings accounts, and GIC products.
