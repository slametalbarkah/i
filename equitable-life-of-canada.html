            The Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada is a Canadian life insurance company that has operated since 1920. The company was founded under a provincial charter as the Ontario Equitable Life and Accident Insurance Company. In 1936, a new company, the Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada, was incorporated under a federal charter and assumed the operations of the Ontario Equitable Life. Equitable was founded as a joint-stock company, but in 1958 began buying back its stock and in 1963 converted to a mutual. As a mutual company, Equitable has remained an independent, medium-size business despite major consolidation in the industry.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Provincial corporation, 1920–1936 ===<br/><br/>The founder and builder of Equitable Life was Sydney Charles Tweed (1886–1942). Tweed was born in Vankleek Hill, Ontario in 1886, while his paternal grandparents had come to Canada from County Antrim. In 1888, the Tweed family moved to Winnipeg, where Sydney attended high school until the age of 15. After leaving school in 1891, he joined the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and remained with the company until 1901. That year, he moved to London, Ontario where he became the district manager for Equitable Life of New York.
