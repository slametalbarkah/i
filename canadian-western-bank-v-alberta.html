            Canadian Western Bank v Alberta [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3 is a landmark decision in Canadian constitutional law by the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) relating to the division of powers between Federal and Provincial legislative bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>In 2000, Alberta enacted changes to its Insurance Act purporting to make federally chartered banks subject to the provincial licensing scheme governing the promotion of insurance products.  Upon the coming into force of that Act, Canadian Western Bank, together with other chartered banks, brought an application for a declaration:<br/><br/><br/><br/>that their promotion of certain insurance products authorized by the Bank Act was banking within the meaning of s. 91(15) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and<br/><br/>that the Insurance Act and its associated regulations were constitutionally inapplicable to the banks' promotion of insurance by virtue of the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity<br/><br/>or, alternatively, <br/><br/>inoperative by virtue of the doctrine of federal paramountcy.<br/><br/>The trial court dismissed the bank application and said:<br/><br/><br/><br/>the Insurance Act is a valid exercise of provincial powers under §92(13),<br/><br/>interjurisdictional immunity also fails because insurance is not "at the core" of banking, and<br/><br/>federal paramountcy does not apply because there is no operational conflict between federal and provincial law.<br/><br/>The appeal court reaffirmed the trial court decision.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Decision ==<br/><br/>The Supreme Court reaffirmed the appeal court.<br/><br/>The Insurance Act and its associated regulations apply to the banks' promotion of insurance. The fact that Parliament allows a bank to enter into a provincially regulated line of business such as insurance cannot, by federal statute, unilaterally broaden the scope of an exclusive federal legislative power granted by the Constitution Act, 1867.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Assessing constitutionality of legislation ===<br/><br/>It was emphasized by the Court that all constitutional legal challenges to legislation should follow the same approach:<br/><br/><br/><br/>the pith and substance of the provincial law and the federal law should be examined to ensure that they are both validly enacted laws and to determine the nature of the overlap, if any, between them.
