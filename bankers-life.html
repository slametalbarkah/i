            The Bankers Life and Casualty Company, doing business as Bankers Life, is a private American health insurance company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1932 as a mutual life insurance company, the company has been a subsidiary of CNO Financial Group since 1992. Bankers Life has 1.4 million policyholders across the United States and Canada, most of whom are within the company's target demographic of middle-aged and retirement-aged adults with annual household incomes between $25,000 and $75,000.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The company's insurance products include life insurance, long-term care insurance, annuities, and Medicare products, including plans for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. The company's in-house supplemental health insurance includes plans for critical illnesses and Medicare supplements, with vision and dental coverage sold through a partnership with Humana.<br/><br/>Bankers Life sells its policies through a network of over 5,000 insurance agents based in over 320 offices throughout the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years ===<br/><br/>The Bankers Life and Casualty Company was established in 1932 as a mutual life insurance company in Chicago, Illinois. In contrast to most other life insurance companies, whose costs included salaries for accountants, sales agents, officers, and actuaries, Bankers Life minimized its overhead as a means of undercutting the monthly insurance premiums of its competitors. By June 1935, however, corporate mismanagement rendered the company insolvent by $631.11 ($14,474 in 2024), resulting in the seizure of its assets for liquidation by the Illinois Insurance Department. On July 2, 1935, the company was sold to John D. MacArthur for $2,500 ($57,336 in 2024), who began running it from the office of his existing insurance company, Marquette Life.
