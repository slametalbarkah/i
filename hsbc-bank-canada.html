            HSBC Bank Canada (French: Banque HSBC Canada), formerly the Hongkong Bank of Canada (HBC), was a British-Canadian chartered bank and the former Canadian subsidiary of British multinational banking and financial services company HSBC founded in 1981.<br/><br/>It was the seventh largest bank in Canada, with offices in every province except Prince Edward Island, and was the largest foreign-owned bank in the country. The corporate headquarters were located at the HSBC Canada Building in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia.<br/><br/>On March 28, 2024, the Royal Bank of Canada closed their acquisition of HSBC Canada. Its Institution Number (or bank number) was 016.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1979, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation bought a Vancouver-based acceptance company that financed machinery and equipment for small companies operating in British Columbia. In 1981, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation incorporated Hongkong Bank of Canada (HBC), in Vancouver as a chartered bank effective July 1, 1981, under the Bank Act of Canada using the acceptance company as a base for the new bank. HBC had a few retail branches primarily focused on Asian-Canadians whose primary business centred on commercial enterprises. HBC opened branches in major cities in western Canada and in Toronto and Montreal but growth was slow. HBC sought to grow by acquisition, but the first three attempts to buy an existing institution were unsuccessful.
