In 1904, these dealers decided to try to reduce their insurance costs by organizing their own insurance company.<br/><br/>Initially, the company was known as the Minnesota Implement Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and retained this name for many years. They would later become the Mutual Implement and Hardware Insurance Company, then Federated Mutual Implement and Hardware Insurance Company and, finally, Federated Mutual Insurance Company ("Federated Mutual").<br/><br/>On January 1, 1948, Federated Mutual entered the casualty insurance field, and was one of the first major insurance companies to write both fire and casualty insurance. In November 1949, accident and health coverage was added, with group accident and health insurance being written for various trade associations and employer groups. Federated Life Insurance Company (or "Federated Life") was organized in January 1959.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Products and Services ==<br/><br/>List of products and services offered by Federated Mutual Insurance Company:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Commercial property and casualty insurance<br/><br/>Life and disability insurance<br/><br/>Risk management and loss prevention resources<br/><br/>Workers compensation insurance<br/><br/>Bonding<br/><br/>Estate planning and financial services<br/><br/>Federated Mutual once offered group health insurance, but ceased this offering at the end of 2017.
