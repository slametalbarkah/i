<h1>Ontario Health Insurance Plan</h1>
            
            The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (French: Assurance-Santé de l'Ontario), commonly known by the acronym OHIP (pronounced  OH-hip), is the government-run health insurance plan for the Canadian province of Ontario. OHIP is funded by a payroll deduction tax by residents who are gainfully employed, by businesses in the province of Ontario, and by transfer payments from the Government of Canada.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Covered services ==<br/><br/>Every Ontario resident with his or her primary and permanent home in Ontario is entitled to access emergency and preventive care under OHIP free of charge. Ontario residents may go to a participating doctor—essentially every doctor practising in the province—any time they wish (subject to the consent of the doctor) and the services are billed through OHIP to the government. <br/><br/>In 2018, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan announced a new program designed to assist individuals struggling with food addiction. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Prescription drug ===<br/><br/>OHIP does not generally cover prescription drugs outside of hospitals or dental care. However, <br/><br/><br/><br/>the Ontario Drug Benefit program pays for prescription drugs for seniors covered by OHIP.<br/><br/>the Trillium Drug Program covers households with high prescription drug costs.<br/><br/>as of 1 January 2018, prescription drugs for those under 25 years of age are covered by OHIP through OHIP+.<br/><br/>As of 1 April 2019, the Ontario government will no longer offer free prescriptions to children and young adults with private coverage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Physiotherapy ===<br/><br/>OHIP coverage for physiotherapy was restricted to those 65 years of age and over, those 19 years of age and under, residents of long-term care homes (regardless of age), individuals who had been hospitalized (regardless of age) and individuals on the Ontario Disability Support Program, Family Benefits and Ontario Works (regardless of age).
