            Affordable housing in Canada refers to living spaces that are deemed financially accessible to households with a median household income. Housing affordability is generally measured based on a shelter-cost-to-income ratio (STIR) of 30% by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the national housing agency of Canada. It encompasses a continuum ranging from market-based options like affordable rental housing and affordable home ownership, to non-market alternatives such as government-subsidized housing (emergency shelters, transitional housing, and public housing).  Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Housing continuum ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The housing continuum includes non-market housing (homelessness, emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, community and social housing) and market housing (below-market rental/ownership, private rental, and home ownership).<br/><br/>As of 2018, the market-based housing system accounted for approximately 80% of Canadian households' housing acquisitions. <br/><br/>About two thirds of Canadian households are home owners, and one third are renters who rent market-rate and non-market units. <br/><br/>In 2016, Canada had a total housing stock of approximately 14 million units. Out of this, social housing units accounted for were 3 percent, which is around 425,000 units. Meanwhile, Germany accounted for 30 percent of social housing units compared to their total housing stock, and Sweden accounted for 20 percent.
