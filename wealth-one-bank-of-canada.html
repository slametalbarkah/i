            Wealth One Bank of Canada (stylized as WealthONE) is a Canadian federally chartered digital Schedule I bank, founded in 2016, to serve the Chinese Canadian community. The bank has been subject to regulatory and legal scrutiny due to national security concerns around its principal shareholders.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Wealth One Bank of Canada was founded by seven key investors. Shenglin Xian attracted other investors, including Yuansheng Ou Yang and Mao Hua Chen, who became directors of the bank. With one other key investor, they raised $50 million as an initial funding for the bank. The investors believed that there was a business opportunity to create a Canadian financial institution that was able to offer services to Chinese Canadians by understanding their culture, traditions and being able to speak their language. The company began working in the early 2010s towards gaining a charter through what its CEO and president at the time, Charles Lambert, described as a "long application process".<br/><br/>On July 22, 2015, WealthONE received its tentative letters patent from Canada's Minister of Finance. The bank was officially chartered federally in 2016 as a Schedule I bank under the Bank Act. As such, it is regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) and is a member of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, a Crown corporation which insures all deposits into its member banks.
