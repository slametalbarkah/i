            The National Citizens Coalition (NCC) is a Canadian conservative lobby group that was incorporated in 1975 by Colin M. Brown, a successful insurance agent who strongly opposed public health insurance—Medicare. In response to what he perceived to be excessive government spending in Canada, Brown had begun an advertisement campaign in 1967. Its slogan is “More freedom through less government.” campaigns against public sector unions and in favour of smaller government and lower taxes.: 197–206 <br/><br/>From 1998 to 2002, the president of the group was Stephen Harper, who served as the 22nd prime minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Mandate ==<br/><br/>The NCC has supported privatization, tax cuts and government spending cuts; it also opposes electoral laws that limit third-party spending. It has been heavily involved in advertising, political campaigns and legal challenges in support of its goals of "more freedom through less government." The Tyee on March 23, 2011, described the NCC as an "Alberta-based think tank that crusades for smaller government and less taxes".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the 1970s, the three federal political parties—the Liberals under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the Conservatives under Robert Stanfield and the NDP under David Lewis—gave no voice to corporate Canada or the business elite in policy making in the Canadian parliament. Stanfield was supportive of state intervention, as a Red Tory. Lewis thought that big business received too many tax breaks and subsidies as "corporate welfare bums." In the 1970s, labour was increasing its power, public safety nets were being introduced, and participatory government was growing. To reverse this trend, from 1974 to 1976, CEOs took major initiatives.: 164  The Business Council on National Issues (BCNI), the Fraser Institute—a conservative: 244  and libertarian: 216, F13  public policy think tank established in 1974, and the National Citizens' Coalition—incorporated in 1975—were formed to change the political culture to support the business elite. The two latter organizations focussed on changing public opinion.: 165 <br/><br/>Incorporated in Ontario in 1975, the NCC was founded by insurance agent Colin M. Brown, who had begun an advertising campaign in 1967 against what he perceived as excessive government spending.
