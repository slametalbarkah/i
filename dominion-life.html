            The Dominion Life Assurance Company was a Canadian life insurance company that existed from 1889 to 1987. The company was founded by a group of businessmen in Waterloo, Ontario and was built over the ensuing decades by managing director Thomas Hilliard. At the end of World War II, Dominion was Canada's ninth-largest life insurance company.<br/><br/>In 1957, the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company of Fort Wayne, Indiana acquired an 89 per cent stake in the company. Due to restrictive regulations on foreign ownership, Lincoln began in 1984 to seek a buyer for its share in Dominion. In 1985, Manulife acquired acquired the company for $157 million. At the time of its acquisition, Dominion was Canada's 11th largest insurer. After the sale, Manulife operated Dominion as a subsidiary for a short time. At the beginning of 1986, Dominion's operations were merged into Manulife, and the company was disincorporated in 1987. During 1986, Manulife transferred its Canadian operations from Toronto to Waterloo, where they have remained since.
