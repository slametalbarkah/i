            The Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC; French: Banque de développement du Canada) is a Crown corporation and national development bank wholly owned by the Government of Canada, mandated to help create and develop Canadian businesses through financing, growth and transition capital, venture capital and advisory services, with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.<br/><br/>Founded in 1944, its corporate headquarters is located in Montreal and it has more than 123 business centres working with 60,000 clients. BDC's debt obligations, secured by the Government of Canada, are issued to public and private sector institutions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The bank was established by an Act of Parliament as the Industrial Development Bank (IDB) in September 1944. IDB was initially an arm of the Bank of Canada, and the Governor of the Bank was also Chief Executive Officer of the IDB. During its first years, the bank's main role was to help small "industrial enterprises" convert from military production to peacetime operations after World War II. IDB was one of the first and largest development banks in the world.<br/><br/>The Industrial Development Bank Act was first amended in 1952 to allow the bank to offer financing to companies in the commercial airlines industry. By the mid-1950s, one in ten planes in Canada was financed by IDB. Later, the Industrial Development Bank Act was amended twice more to allow the bank to lend to companies in almost all industries.<br/><br/>By 1964, 20 years after its foundation, IDB had 22 branches across Canada, covering main cities such as Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver, including operations in relatively rural areas. In the mid-1970s, the bank added consulting and training to its financial offerings to help entrepreneurs better manage their businesses.<br/><br/>In 1975, its name was changed to Federal Business Development Bank (FBDB), and its venture capital operations were started.
