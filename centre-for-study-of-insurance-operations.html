            CSIO, the Centre for Study of Insurance Operations, is the Canadian property and casualty insurance industry's nonprofit association of insurers, brokers and software providers. Much of its work is in the development of data standards, especially XML and EDI, for the transmission of insurance information throughout the Canadian P&amp;C insurance industry.<br/><br/>CSIO also promotes the adoption of various technologies within the industry, such as telematics and electronic signature, that promise to enhance efficiencies in the broker distribution channel. For example, as part of its XML standards, CSIO released a telematics data standard in January 2014 to facilitate the process of transferring driving data from an insurance customer's vehicle to an insurance company. CSIO worked together with the US insurance standards organization ACORD on the telematics initiative.<br/><br/>Regarding the electronic signature initiative, in the summer of 2014, CSIO developed and published the eSignatures Vendor Dashboard, a resource for insurance brokers to help them research and choose an e-signature software solution.<br/><br/>CSIO has campaigned for the adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) among brokers and insurers in the Canadian property and casualty industry. In 2014, CSIO released its TLS Chart, showing that over 1,200 member brokerages across Canada use TLS.<br/><br/>CSIO has promoted the concept of the paperless office to Canadian brokerages. It developed the eDocs data standard in order to help brokers and insurance companies transition away from the printing and mailing of paper documents. Various companies within the Canadian insurance industry support and have adopted the CSIO eDocs standard to make their workflows more paperless.
