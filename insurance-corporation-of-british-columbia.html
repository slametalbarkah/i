            The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) is a provincial Crown corporation in British Columbia providing vehicle insurance. ICBC was created in 1973 by the NDP government of Premier Dave Barrett.<br/><br/>By law, any vehicle registered and driven or parked on public streets in British Columbia must be covered by ICBC's basic insurance package, which can be purchased from independent brokers across the province.  This basic coverage, called "Autoplan," includes protection from third party legal liability, under-insured motorist protection, accident benefits, and inverse liability (which provides compensation if a driver is involved in an accident in jurisdictions that forbid drivers from recovering losses incurred from a driver who is at fault in the accident).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The original purpose of ICBC was to provide universal and affordable compulsory public auto insurance in British Columbia by operating on a non-profit basis. However, in March 2010, Christy Clark's BC Liberal government announced that it would require ICBC to pay the province dividends totaling some $778 million over three years, thus signaling the end of ICBC's operation as a non-profit Crown corporation, and also making it the only for-profit public auto insurance provider in Canada. These dividends eventually totaled $1.2 billion. This was undone by the NDP government after their victory in the 2017 BC provincial election, who subsequently passed legislation ensuring ICBC's profits remain with the company and cannot be transferred to the provincial government. Since ICBC's creation, its responsibilities have expanded to include driver licensing, vehicle registration, and various road safety initiatives.<br/><br/>When ICBC was established, it initially held a monopoly on all automobile insurance in the province, but in 1977 its enabling legislation was amended to allow private insurers to compete with it in the market for optional (supplemental) insurance (including coverage such as extended liability, collision, and comprehensive plans).
