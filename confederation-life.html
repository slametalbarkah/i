            Confederation Life Insurance Company was a Canadian insurance company and financial services provider. Its global head office was located in Toronto in what is now the Rogers Building. The company had operations in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Bermuda, and an inactive office in Cuba. The company was forced into liquidation in 1994.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Foundation and growth ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The company was founded in 1871 by John Kay Macdonald (1837–1928) in Toronto, then established operations in the UK in 1906 (with a head office at Stevenage, Hertfordshire) and later into the United States with offices in Atlanta.<br/><br/>Macdonald retired in 1920 and was succeeded by Charles Strange Macdonald from 1921 to 1946 and then John Kenneth Macdonald from 1946 to 1969. John Kenneth Macdonald's daughters, Peggy Latimer and Ann Macintosh, never were operationally involved in the firm, but they did inherit ownership from their father.<br/><br/>In 1969, J. Craig Davidson became president and for the first time, the firm was no longer led by a member of the Macdonald family.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Demise ===<br/><br/>Confederation Life was forced into liquidation in 1994, with the process beginning on August 11. The international operations of the company made the liquidation process somewhat complex.
