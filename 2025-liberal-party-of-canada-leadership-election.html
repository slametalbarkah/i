            From February 26 to March 9, 2025, members of the Liberal Party of Canada voted on a successor for Justin Trudeau after he announced his intent to resign as the party leader and prime minister of Canada.<br/><br/>Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada, won the ranked-choice voting (RCV) election with over 85% of the first-preference vote and points, as well as a majority in all 343 ridings. This margin of victory surpassed Justin Trudeau's 2013 leadership victory margin in vote share, points, and ridings. <br/><br/>Carney was sworn in as prime minister on March 14, the first prime minister in Canadian history to not have previously held elected office. Carney subsequently called a snap federal election on March 23, where he will run in Nepean.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>In 2013, Justin Trudeau was elected as the leader of the Liberal Party. He led the party to victory in the 2015 federal election, with a majority government, and was re-elected in 2019 and 2021 with minority governments. On March 22, 2022, the Liberals reached a confidence and supply agreement with the New Democratic Party (NDP), who agreed to support the Liberal government until June 2025 in exchange for specific policy commitments.<br/><br/>Throughout 2024, public support for the Liberal Party declined. On June 24, the Liberals lost the Toronto—St.
