<h1>Alberta Health Insurance Act (1935)</h1>
            
            The Alberta Health Insurance Act was an act passed by the Alberta Legislature in February 1935.  It was the first Canadian health insurance act to provide some public funding for medical services, and as such is considered to be an early step toward the provision of medicare in Canada.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/>In 1932, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta prepared a brief for a commission on health care reform that had been established by the Government of Alberta.  The brief was presented by Albert Ernest Archer, an early supporter of public health care in Canada.  The commission subsequently established a prepaid health insurance program for rural areas, and an employer/employee program for urban centres, with the province paying two-ninths of the total costs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Context ==<br/><br/>The Alberta Health Insurance Act of 1934 was first proposed by the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA). The legislation proposed to provide health care to the every province resident at an annual cost of $14.50 per person (Canadian Dollars). However, the Act was unable to pass before the UFA was defeated out of office by the Social Credit Party. The plan would require health care providers to provide specific services for the insured at no extra cost. These services included "full-time public health service", "complete medical service" (including major and minor surgery and obstetrics), "drugs and surgical appliances" if prescribed, limited "dental service", "private nursing service" (under special circumstances) and "hospitalization" (x-rays, operating room, lab services, etc.).
