<h1>Canada Child Benefit</h1>
            
            The Canada Child Benefit (CCB), previously the Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB), is an income-tested basic income program for Canadian families. It is delivered as a tax-free monthly payment available to eligible Canadian families to help with the cost of raising children. The CCTB could incorporate the National Child Benefit (NCB), a monthly benefit for low-income families with children, and the Child Disability Benefit (CDB), a monthly benefit for families caring for children with severe and prolonged mental or physical disabilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The CCTB was enacted in response to a commitment made by the Canadian parliament, in November 1989, to eradicate child poverty in Canada by the year 2000.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Child Tax Benefit (CTB, 1993–1998) ===<br/><br/>The federal finance minister, Don Mazankowski, announced in the 1992 Canadian federal budget the introduction in January 1993 of a renewed and enriched Child Tax Benefit (CTB) that consolidates the family allowance, the child credit and refundable child tax credit into a unified benefit of $1,020 per child (with a supplementary benefit of $75 for the third child and following children). Unlike family allowance that it replaces, this monthly payment is not taxable for the recipient. This measure was estimated to increase benefits by $2.1 billions over a period of five years. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Working Income Supplement (WIS) ====<br/><br/>The new benefit includes an earned-income supplement (referred to as the Working income supplement or WIS in future federal budgets) of up to $500 (per family) designed to deliver increased benefits for low-income working families with children. The supplement phases-in at 8% of earned income above $3,750 ; reaches its maximum amount ($500) between $10,000 and $20,921 of earned income and is subsequently reduced by 10% of earning income above $20,921 (i.e. is fully exhausted at $25,921 of earned income).
