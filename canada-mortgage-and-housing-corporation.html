            Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC; French: Société canadienne d'hypothèques et de logement, SCHL) is Canada's federal crown corporation responsible for administering the National Housing Act, with the mandate to improve housing by living conditions in the country.<br/><br/>Originally established after World War II to help returning war veterans find housing, it has since seen its mandate expand to the mandate of improving access to housing overall.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>The CMHC operates with a primary mandate of providing mortgage liquidity, assisting in establishing affordable housing development, and providing arms-length advice to the Government of Canada and the housing industry.<br/><br/>The crown corporation acts as Canada's national housing agency. As such, it administers federal housing programs such as the first-time home buyer loan, acts as a mortgage insurer (primarily for high-leverage loans), and provides housing research.<br/><br/>The agency's governance is led by an independent board of directors. However, the board is appointed by the Government of Canada and the agency is directly accountable to Parliament through the Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. <br/><br/>CMHC is the largest crown corporation in terms of assets, with CA$295 billion in assets as of the second quarter of 2021.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Wartime Housing Limited ===<br/><br/>In 1941, the Government of Canada established the Wartime Housing Limited (WHL), a crown corporation that built and managed thousands of rental units for World War II workers and veterans. (Rural housing under the 1942 Veterans' Land Act remained with the Department of Veterans' Affairs.)<br/><br/>During that time, an Advisory Committee on Reconstruction study (aka the Curtis Report) described a tremendous need for low and moderate income shelter throughout Canada, and recommended a national, comprehensive, and planned housing program emphasizing low-rental housing.
