            Emergency medical services in Canada are the responsibility of each Canadian province or territory.  The services, including both ambulance and paramedic services, may be provided directly by the province, contracted to a private provider, or delegated to local governments, which may, in turn, create service delivery arrangements with municipal departments, hospitals, or private providers.  The approach, and the standards, vary considerably between provinces and territories.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Organization ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Rail ambulances ===<br/><br/>A rail ambulance is a vehicle used for medical transportation services on railway lines. The first rail ambulance was set up in 1920, in order to enable injured people to be transported to the nearest hospital, was set up in the coal mining community of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. The car ran between #3 and #7 mines and Town of Sydney Mines. It was discontinued in 1922.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Land ambulance ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Responsibility for emergency medical services (EMS), as a part of health care in general, lies with the provinces and territories of Canada.  With the exceptions of British Columbia and Alberta, which operate their EMS services directly, the method used for service delivery varies between jurisdictions.  Typically, the provincial/territorial government provides enabling legislation, technical standards, accreditation or licensing, and oversight to a variety of operators, including municipalities, hospitals, and private companies.
